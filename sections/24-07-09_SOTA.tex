Xiaobai: Juntang showed one more time that he can teach himself a lot of new concepts and methods in a short time.

He made a first BIG step in SOTA study and made a very nice presentation.

\subsubsection*{** Problem description:**}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data dimensions and features:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item spatial and/or temporal + spectral (up to 5D cube)
        \item in detail, resolution in each dimension
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Analysis task(s):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item segmentation / clustering / object-recognition
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{** Models}
\begin{itemize}
    \item linking data to analysis tasks
    \item Most used models (combinatorial, probabilistic)
    \item Data specific (a priori information)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{** Methods (\& tools, packages)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Most used methods
    \item \textbf{Datasets}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Public
        \item Small for learning/testing
        \item Large for exploration
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy assessments (measures)}
\end{itemize}
